## Getting and Cleaning Data Project


### Overview
This project is to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a data set that can be used for further
analysis. Details on the data set used in this project can be found in the CodeBook.md .

### Description of the script
The script downloads file and unzips it. There are commented out the following features that can be uncommented and edited according to user's needs: cleaning up workspace and setting chosen directory for work.

The script checks if the libraries used by it are installed. If not, the script will install them and then load.

All data subsets needed for this project are read and dealt with, according to Project Summary (below).

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.md file.
